# Authenticating requests

To authenticate requests, include an **`Authorization`** header with the value **`"Bearer your-token"`**.

All authenticated endpoints are marked with a `requires authentication` badge in the documentation below.

If your account has API access enabled, you can generate a token by clicking in the top right account menu and clicking <b>API tokens</b>.
